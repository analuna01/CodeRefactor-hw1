# H1.CodeRefactor
Homework1:
For this project, the goal was to improve the functionality of the webpage by polishing
some aspects of the html and css files. Throughout my work I did encounter some challenges
that included the images not appearing on the website even after adding alt tags but furtunatelly 
I was able to meet with a TA for assistance and that problem was resolved. Another challenge was to detach the footer from the aside part of the website and after going back and forth between
the html and css files I was finally able to adjust it.

Overall, I believe I made the appropiate updates to make this website more user friendly.
